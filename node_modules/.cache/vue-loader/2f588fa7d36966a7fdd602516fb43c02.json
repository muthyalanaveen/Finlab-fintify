The arbitrator\n        will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference,\n        rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines\n        upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate.\n        Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably\n        convenient to the parties with due consideration of their ability to\n        travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to\n        agree on a location, such determination will be made by the AAA or by\n        the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of\n        arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation,\n        we will, to the extent required to make this Section 16 enforceable, pay\n        as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the\n        arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration\n        from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator will be bound by these\n        Terms, when not in conflict with applicable law, and the\n        arbitrator&#39;s decision will be binding and final, subject only to\n        limited right of judicial review provided under the Federal Arbitration\n        Act. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or\n        permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance\n        of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief\n        warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. If the\n        arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy\n        you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, we may\n        use the applicable Rules to determine whether you are responsible for\n        the filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. The award rendered by\n        the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having\n        jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in\n        these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of\n        federal, state or local government agencies or from seeking public\n        injunctive relief in court where that right cannot be waived under\n        applicable state law.\n      </o-text>\n      <o-text class=\"mt-2\">\n        You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and\n        submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first agreeing to these\n        Terms. However, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that\n        allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out\n        or not opt out remains binding.\n      </o-text>\n      <o-text class=\"mt-2\">\n        If any part of this &quot;Governing Law; Mandatory Arbitration&quot;\n        section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will\n        remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or\n        unenforceability would allow class or representative arbitration, this\n        &quot;Governing Law; Mandatory Arbitration&quot; section will be\n        unenforceable in its entirety. If you are found to have a non-waivable\n        right to bring a particular claim or to request a particular form of\n        relief that the arbitrator lacks authority to redress or award according\n        to this &quot;Governing Law; Mandatory Arbitration&quot; section, then\n        only that respective claim or request for relief may be brought in\n        court, and you and we agree that litigation of any such claim or request\n        for relief shall be stayed pending the resolution of any individual\n        claim(s) or request(s) for relief in arbitration.\n      </o-text>\n      <o-text class=\"pb-3\">\n        Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents can invoke our\n        rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a\n        dispute with you.
