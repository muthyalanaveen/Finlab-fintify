        When you initiate a return through the Services, you are committing to
        return the item to the retailer in accordance with the retailer&#39;s
        return policy, and you will comply with any relevant requirements set

        In our discretion, we may offer you as part of the returns experience
        the ability to use the amount of your return refund immediately to

        Funds&quot;). Those Instant Exchange Funds may only be used for a
        purchase from the same retailer that is processing your return. By
        accepting Instant Exchange Funds, you are agreeing to promptly return
        the initial item to the retailer within the return window set forth in
        the retailer&#39;s return policies. Instant Exchange Funds will be
        offered some but not all of the time and in Optoro&#39;s sole
        discretion. Those funds are issued for a limited period of time, will
        expire and will not be reissued upon expiration. Upon expiration of
        those funds, or if you determine you do not wish to use them, you may
        still return your item in accordance with the applicable retailer&#39;s
        return policies and any refund to which you are entitled will be
        processed according to that retailer&#39;s policies.

        relationship with the retailer. Optoro may take reasonable measures to
        prevent fraud. If we determine that you have failed to return an item
        for which you have been extended Instant Exchange Funds, or have
        otherwise engaged in fraudulent activity in connection with the use of
        the Services, Optoro may suspend or terminate your access to or use of
        the Services, and pursue any criminal or civil remedies available to us.

        The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
        Association (the &quot; <strong>AAA</strong>&quot;) under the Consumer
        Arbitration Rules (the &quot; <strong>Rules</strong>&quot;) (available
        from the AAA at www.adr.org), as amended by these Terms. The arbitrator
        will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference,
        rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines
        upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate.
        Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably
        convenient to the parties with due consideration of their ability to
        travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to
        agree on a location, such determination will be made by the AAA or by
        the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of
        arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation,
        we will, to the extent required to make this Section 16 enforceable, pay
        as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the
        arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration
        from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator will be bound by these
        Terms, when not in conflict with applicable law, and the
        arbitrator&#39;s decision will be binding and final, subject only to
        limited right of judicial review provided under the Federal Arbitration
        Act. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or
        permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance
        of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief
        warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. If the
        arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy
        you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, we may
        use the applicable Rules to determine whether you are responsible for
        the filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. The award rendered by
        the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having
        jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in
        these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of
        federal, state or local government agencies or from seeking public
        injunctive relief in court where that right cannot be waived under
        applicable state law.

        You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and

        allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out
        or not opt out remains binding.

        If any part of this &quot;Governing Law; Mandatory Arbitration&quot;
        section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will
        remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or
        unenforceability would allow class or representative arbitration, this
        &quot;Governing Law; Mandatory Arbitration&quot; section will be
        unenforceable in its entirety. If you are found to have a non-waivable
        right to bring a particular claim or to request a particular form of
        relief that the arbitrator lacks authority to redress or award according
        to this &quot;Governing Law; Mandatory Arbitration&quot; section, then
        only that respective claim or request for relief may be brought in
        court, and you and we agree that litigation of any such claim or request
        for relief shall be stayed pending the resolution of any individual
        claim(s) or request(s) for relief in arbitration.
